# Hangman-Solver-Hybrid-Ensemble-of-Specialized-Experts
Hangman Solver uses a hybrid ensemble of 5 neural experts (3 Transformers, 2 CANINE) to dynamically adapt guesses. Early game: dictionary stats. Mid/late: weighted expert voting. Achieves high precision via specialization and fallbacks. Outperforms single-model approaches.
